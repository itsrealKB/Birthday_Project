    failed you. I'm sorry for whenever I didn't meet your expectations.
    I know we've had our fair share of arguements, mostly because, well
    you are a kid :D . Even if I was right in every argument, it still
    wouldn't make it any less painful to accept the fact that you get
    hurt too.`

    "Top 10 beautiful girls in the world" and didn't see your face. God
    must have ran out of beautiness creating you. Even the angels must
    be gossiping about your stunning beauty. And of course, you know
    your eyes are my favourites.`

    you are well aware of, most of the work is done by my janu Baroch.
    See, since I'm not paying him, I have to give him a shoutout 😂.`
